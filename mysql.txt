//doubt
when a new company is added, let's say the company is releasing 500 shares into the market. So to whom do these shares belong?
suppose I want to buy 100 shares from that company, then to whom the money that I pay goes to?
Or is it that the shares released at the begginng are owned by some user, so that we can add that money into that account
